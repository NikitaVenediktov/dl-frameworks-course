It's not a serious question but it was floating around my mind: Where/ how did the New Jedi get lightsabers after the Sequel Trilogy?	36	1220k6e	KingPenguinPhoenix	https://i.redd.it/mog0w00700qa1.jpg	55	1679781289.0	Just so you know, I've only watched the movies and TV shows and played 2 games. If the answer is in another game or in a book/ comic book, please let me know and tell me the answer.Anyway, from what we know in canon, there are only 2 places in the galaxy (so far) that produce Kyber Crystals (the power source for lightsabers), Ilum and Jedah (hope I spelled those right)However, these places all have a history to them. Jedah was destroyed by the Empire using the Death Star in Rouge One and Ilum got turned into Star Killer base which was destroyed in the Force Awakens.So this made me think, where would the Jedi in Rey's new Order find Kyber Crystal's for their lightsabers if the two sources of them are gone.Again, thus question doesn't make or break the franchise, so I wouldn't be surprised if no one bothered to cone up with an answer, but if you do got somethingfrom the greater lore, I'd really love to hear it.
Spoiler On New Republic Policy (Mandalorian S03E03)	268	11skx3j	cupnoodlefreak	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/11skx3j/spoiler_on_new_republic_policy_mandalorian_s03e03/	43	1678943577.0	"(Apologies about violating spoiler policy, please remove if new title is still too spoilery)There seems to be a lot of disbelief or shock about the fact that the New Republic was decommissioning both the Alliance fleet and the Imperial Fleet within just a few years of Jakku, when there are still imperial holdouts and pirates left in the galaxy. The reaction seems to be that this is a shortsighted and stupid move, and in retrospect, given the rise of the First Order it might be, but I think it was both a realistic move and an understandable one; a postwar democracy would be hard-pressed to economically or politically justify the maintenance of a wartime fleet in peacetime, however embarrassingly inadequate they would look when war comes around, for several reasons.1. Civilians Don't Like Wartime Spending or Taxation in PeacetimeThe first Federal Income Tax in the United States was passed under the Lincoln Administration in 1861( (and amended to be progressive in 1862) to support the Union war effort as part of the Civil War. But it didn't long outlast it, being allowed to expire in 1872 under the Grant Administration as it proved increasingly unpopular. The Wilson Administration passed Wartime Excess Profits Acts that expired after the end of the war, and FDR introduced a temporary ""Victory Tax( during World War II, a particularly herculean effort for the United States which (at its height) comprised over 40% of the nation's GDP( and mobilized more than one out of every ten Americans at the time( And for good reason; the US was fighting literal nazis on one side of the world and a nation whose war crimes were at least competitive with the literal nazis. But US public appetite for rationing and mobilization drained away almost as soon as the war was over, however worried people up top were about the threat of the Soviet Union (which had reneged on whatever promises it had made to respect democracy in Czechoslovakia( and Poland by 1948). US troops rioted because they weren't being sent home fast enough( And, though the Truman Administration worried about the expansion of Communism, it couldn't defend the same level of militarization or taxation after the war. It proceeded with a severe drawdown of military budgets and forces that saw a public revolt by the navy( and saw the United States severely underprepared and underequipped for the Korean War (to the extent that the US had to pull public display pieces back into service to face the North Koreans( and when Truman called for a blockade of North Korea he found himself without enough ships to do it( The fact is that Civilians tolerate a justified war, but they expect, in post-WWI terms, a ""return to normalcy"" and for the guns to be beaten back into plowshares once that war is done, whatever the potential dangers for the future. In a democracy (even one that glorifies its military as much as the United States) politicians have to respond to public sentiment, and after four years of war Americans felt pretty done.The New Republic came out of the Galactic Civil War in a much worse position than the United States. For most of the civil war the Rebel Alliance had no ""tax base,"" it lived on donations from sympathizers from the Empire. The war had officially lasted seven years (more realistically nine), and had touched the entire Galaxy. Unlike the World War II United States, the New Republic did not have the 16th Amendment giving them the legitimacy to demand the taxes commensurate with maintaining a large standing fleet; in fact, they were cobbled together from systems that most likely had joined them because they resented an empire that taxed them too much in the first place. When planets need to be rebuilt, displaced peoples needed to be resettled (like everybody from Alderaan who happened to be offworld, for a start), and an economy revived, it's hard to justify military spending. At this juncture, every New Republic credit spent on a frankly dated Y-wing is not spent on rebuilding homes or on social programs, every crew member serving on a Mon Cal is not home with tehir family. The exact arguments one could have against the Military-Industrial Complex in the United States today could be levied against the New Republic if it were to attempt to maintain a wartime fleet; it's just hard to politically justify maintaining massive fleets when it could be spent to improve civilian lives, especially because:2. Equipment Maintenance is ExpensiveThe US Air Force wants to get rid of its planes, but Congress (until very recently) wouldn't let them( The  USAF has been pushing for over half a decade to get rid of the A-10 Warthog, well-known for its oversized minigun (and its blue-on-blue incidents during the War on Terror). While the Warthog put in valuable service in the wars in the 90s up to the Libyan Civil War, the Warthog is showing its age, and the 42 the USAF wants to cut costs $343.9 million a year to maintain( Warships, warplanes, tanks, these things rust and fall apart if not maintained properly (as the Russians are discovering); a third of the US military's costs today are related with maintenance of facilities; dockyards, warehouses and spare parts facilities as well as the equipment itself. After World War II most of the most well-known vessels of the war were broken up, and the US was happy to give destroyers to basically anyone who wanted them( because the US Navy (now the largest in the world) was far too expensive to maintain on a peacetime budget. It doesn't help that:3. The Alliance Fleet is a logistical NightmareConjure your mental image of the Rebel Alliance from the OT. The Y-wing, a clone-wars era vessel with its exposed machinery because, canonically, was so maintenance-intensive that the mechanics couldn't be arsed to keep the armor plating on( The Mon Calamari Cruisers, some of which were originally whole cities( retrofitted for war, originally Imperial Nebulon B( and retrofitted civilian freighters( And of course there's the Millenium Falcon, which survives on spit, prayers and superstition. In Endor we saw four starfighters (the X-Wing, Y-Wing, A-Wing and B-Wing), built by four different manufacturers with most likely little overlap in parts. This is the inevitable result of different rebel cells with different supply chains and availability coalescing together, but it makes for a painful hodgepodge of logistical tails that would make what the Ukrainian Armed Forces are dealing with now( seem like a cakewalk. Even if the New Republic had no intention of downsizing its navy, the least it could do is to mitigate this nightmare by standardizing to a few classes of capital ships and fighter.But all of this brings up the questions of the other fleet in the picture. What about the Imperial Fleet? Unlike the Alliance Fleet, the Imperial Fleet is a standardized fleet with a unified logistics chain whose capital ships are mostly made at Kuat Drive Yards and whose fighters are made at Sienar. Frankly, it would make more sense for the New Republic to scrap the Alliance Fleet and adopt the existing Imperial ISD fleet, as the New Republic did in EU/Legends. So why didn't they? My guess is two main reasons:1. Much of the Imperial logistics apparatus had been degraded or destroyed as the Empire collapsed at the same time that the Alliance's capital shipbuilding industry had rose up as it became increasingly capable of conventional operations; the New Republic had spent most of the civil war destroying the very shipyards and infrastructure the Empire used to maintain these ships, such as Kuat( and Fondor( whereas the Alliance's shipyards, however disparate, were fully functioning.2. It would be politically unacceptable to move away from the manufacturers that had supplied the Rebellion. In the US, congress refused to let the Air Force scraps its warthogs and builds more tanks than the Army wants( because contracts to build them employs factory workers in their home states. It would be political suicide to alienate key Rebel planets like Mon Calamari by moving shipbuilding contracts from their shipyards to a literal enemy like Kuat, or to force them to make or maintain designs uncomfortable for their physiology like ISDs.Additionally,4. Technology Moves OnIt's easy to look at the Sequel Trilogy and see this as a sign that this decommissioning of the Alliance Fleet is what doomed the New Republic, but remember that Starkiller base first opened fire nearly 30 years after the Battle of Jakku. Much of the Alliance Fleet (A-wings, Y-wings, the Corellian Blockade Runner, at least) were already clone wars-era vessels that were frankly close to obsolete. By the First Order conflict, the T-65 X-wing's successor, the Resistance T-70, was already on the way to being replaced by the T-80( The A-wing has been upgraded, too, and the only other Galactic Civil War-era starfighter in service is this piece of shit( Whether or not the New Republic Fleet by TFA was sufficient, the ships that were decommissioned after Jakku would probably have been little better than flying coffins against the First Order anyway. Another factor attesting to this is how miserably the 1,080 Imperial-design star destroyers( at Exegol (by all accounts a fleet-annihilating force even at the peak of the Empire, given the number of star destroyers we see at Hoth and Endor) performed against an uncoordinated hodgepodge of New Republic Remnants, armed civilian vessels and whatever the hell ""people"" meant in that movie meant. Sure, its crews were untested and the ships planet-bound, but that was ""1,080 star destroyers,"" and they were facing a cobbled-together mass of ships that were probably even less coordinated than they were. My guess is that their destruction is as much a testament to the obsolescence of the Imperial Star Destroyer design by the Sequel Era as it is a testament the verve and motivation of that stupid """"It's just...people"""" line. Nor do we know how powerful the New Republic Fleet was; given that the X-wings they were retiring (the T-70s) outperformed the First Order's top of the line craft, it's possible that the New Republic Navy would have completely mopped the floor with the First Order had they foreseen that the enemy had a planet destroyer that could annihilate five planets across the fucking galaxy. With a thirty-year gap, attributing the First Order's victory to the failure to maintain fifty-year old vessels is akin to attributing the Fall of France in WWII to the French failing to maintain their cavalry breastplates from the Franco-Prussian War. And lastly, I think the most important thing is that5. It (mostly) worked.For nearly 30 years between Jakku and Starkiller Base, the New Republic saw no major existential threat and was able to (mostly) rebuild and recover from the civil war. However small it was, the New Republic Fleet that got wiped offscreen outside of Hosnian Prime was powerful enough to forestall a major conflict for 29 years; for context, even disregarding lower-intensity wars and military interventions, since its inception the United States has only had two periods in which it has gone over 30 years without being involved in a major conflict (31 years in 1815-1846 during which the US was fighting wars with multiple American Indian tribes, 33 years from 1865-1898) in its history. That would have been thirty years in which the Senate would have been facing pressure to draw down its military-industrial spending even if it had kept a wartime fleet past the events of the Mandalorian. Yes, there were pirates and imperial holdouts, but wars rarely end as cleanly (if it could be called clean, given the fate of Europe and China after 1945) as World War II; after the Revolutionary War, the British retreated to forts on the frontier and continued to harass the Americans; after the Civil War, 20,000 Confederates fled to Brazil, the last nation to allow Slavery( after the Spanish-American War, the US fought a bloody and brutal counterinsurgency( against the Filipinos, who had expected to be liberated and found themselves occupied, and after the first World War Europe simply shrugged off the civil war in Russia and the nations that formed out of Austria-Hungary and Russia such as Poland, Ukraine and Lithuania, all of whom fought among themselves, with and against the Red and White Armies. Hidden in distant and hidden star systems in the outer rim, it's not surprising that the New Republic failed to find the political will or economic power to stay on a wartime footing against what they saw as a defeated army.  That scattered remnants like the First Order were able to somehow assemble galaxy-conquering top-of-the-line fleets is in my opinion much less realistic and much more attributable to the ""Somehow Palpatine Came Back"" level of contrivance of the sequels than the fact that the New Republic felt the need to demobilize its civil war-era fleet to a peacetime level.tl;dr as a democracy, it would have been difficult for the new republic to defend maintaining vast wartime fleets when its main enemy was defeated to the public."

In the first episode, we saw a giant-ass Jurassic World-looking dinosaur thingy that seemed to take out at least a dozen adult Mandolorians. Then in the latest episode, we got a giant space-age pterodactyl who picks off Mandolorians and foundlings like they are chips in a Pringles' can, and they just let it happen?! They can't even defend themselves from these beasts, needing to rely on Din Djarin's pimped-out Naboo starfighter and Bo Katan's ship.Like I understand that they are in exile/hiding in refuge from the remaining remnants of the empire and other foes, but surely they could have found a safer planet to inhabit, right? I mean, there is probably a reason this planet is abandoned, judging by the plethora of ginormous space beasts that eat anything in their sights. Also, the place is a fucking desert, so they are surely sweating balls under all that Beskar armor. Why do they even live there? Are they stupid?

Why are people not enjoying the new season of The Mandolorian?	0	12ce2af	PsychologicalFuture3	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/12ce2af/why_are_people_not_enjoying_the_new_season_of_the/	62	1680685503.0	Before I say anything I realise people all have their own opinions and I respect that and I don't mean any disrespect towards people.e who disagree with me here.I, myself am absolutely loving the new season especially with Katee Sackhoff (the absolute queen of sci-fi imo) seemingly becoming a permanent fixture so I'm curious as to why it seems to be getting reviewed poorly? The only mistake made so far to me is the appearance of a young Luke Skywalker, I honestly think if it wasn't for that ark of the story line they could have made the next movies absolutely epic, however i believe its still possible to do so? Now I should state im not an expert in the lore of the star wars universe so please forgive me if I'm incorrect in some ways towards that at all, but was it not stated that the original owner of the dark saber was both jedi and mandolorian? I mean to me this could have set up Grogu as the perfect protagonist for the new movies and giving the franchise a much needed boost since episodes 7,8 and 9 were so poorly received. Again this is just my opinion but I actually enjoyed them, far more than I did the prequels (episodes 1,2 and 3) as I thought the actors and characters were far better written and portrayed.Again this all just my opinion and am in no way saying people are wrong simply because they don't like something that I do, I'm just curious as to the reasons why?
Andor was everything I want from Star Wars	5009	1236dfc	randorolian	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/1236dfc/andor_was_everything_i_want_from_star_wars/	596	1679879582.0	I can't stop going back to this goddamn show. The dialogue, the monologues, the action, the set pieces, the story arcs, the politics, the characters, the soundtrack, the gritty sense of reality. Andor hit me as hard, emotionally, as the OT and RoTS. I can't believe a show that I thought would just be a random series about a throwaway character ended up being my favourite piece of Star Wars content, period. I miss new episodes of this show so bad. I just want more.

I remember the very obvious moral divide...the Good vs Evil element in that movie. I cheered the underdog but good Rebels that fought against the mighty but bad Empire. Ah simpler times. But I'm glad I grew up and the Galaxy grew up with me... Among the most beautiful things that I have seen the Star Wars incorporate is the moral fluidity that is inevitably part of humanity... Individuals and societies. How our idea of good and evil, loyalties and alliances, changes constantly. And how it (a little depressingly) reflects our world today. We see the New Republic rise in hope from the ashes of the Empire only to become a soulless bureaucratic machine in the Mandalorian, and I can't help but notice how similar it is to the soulless bureaucratic machine that the Rebellion was formed to fight, as portrayed in Andor.Teaches me not to see our world today in black and white terms as the news would have one believe.

It sort of worked for the last 30,000 years, but recent Star Wars projects seem to imply that that is not what the galaxy wants or needs right now. And from a worldbuilding perspective, it's much more interesting to have the galaxy split into several political regions rather than one massive civilization.

Im all for cameos and campy feel in star wars but this was not it. Really couldn't bear Lizzo and JB wasn't too great either. Ofc Din gives his lightsaber to Bo, for her to rule Mandalore again. Nothing against her but I just wanted to see Din do some cool shit with the darksaber in his own show, or even be a reluctant ruler. I feel like Din's importance in this show is reducing for Bo's importance to increase and I don't appreciate it. And Grogu was kind of useless this episode, makes me wish that he did some more Jedi training.

Much to my surprise, they love the prequels. Several of them say their favorite character is (I can hardly type this) Jar Jar. They loved episode 1 and 2 (they skipped episode 3). They liked new hope and empire but skipped Jedi to watch episodes 7  8 - which they LOVED!!! Then they watched some Mando. I recall when the prequels came out and there was so much hate for them. I think in a few years we will see the new trilogy starting to get love by todays kids like the prequels are now from the kids who grew up with it.

So using the same logic, the emperor was kept alive by the dark side of the force due to his fractured soul. Therefore the plot hole is filled by saying Palpatine is Lord Voldemort...Please don't ban me, just drunk couch thoughts.
How Did The Empire Just Become The New Republic?	2	124hrkh	Klutzy-Courage-7845	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/124hrkh/how_did_the_empire_just_become_the_new_republic/	23	1679991467.0	Hi everyone,Watching the Mandalorian episode two weeks back triggered a question that I thought Id ask here.How did the empire actually fall and become the new republic. Now, obviously I know Palpatine died, but that doesnt automatically mean the entire empire falls, right? Youd think itd just be reorganised. But instead it seems the Rebels just took over. Did the senate ever consider voting for a new emperor? Idk if theres a book on it, but the immediate aftermath of the fall of the emperor would be cool.Although now that I think of it, thats kinda what the Battlefront 2 campaign is about, (which I quit after Iden joked the rebels.) let me know if they explain it there.

The Empire in Andor is filled with the sort of ruthlessness and political in-fighting you'd expect from a Sith-created organization, even at the bureaucratic level, which echoes in the way it ended (the second-in-command taking out their leader).Meanwhile, the same sentiment that won the war for the Rebels (ragtag team spirit and redemption) are being used as a New Republic governing ethos, and you can already see how it's taking them down the wrong path. The misplaced trust, lack of curiosity in how the Empire  worked, and nave idealism that ""we're the good guys and cannot fail"" are creating the exact conditions that led to creation of the First Order right under their noses. In both Legends and Canon, the post RotJ New Republic has been thwarted because the Rebels were not good at learning how to govern, and it's cool to see this derailment happen in realtime."

If you've ever slept in a car seat, you know he'd be basically crippled after a week or so. You also have to eat almost every meal in a restaurant, cause u have no fridge."
The new Republic was clearly based on coruscant in Mando, how did Hosnian prime getting blown up in VII completely wipe out the NR?	0	126lui9	L-Digital82	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/126lui9/the_new_republic_was_clearly_based_on_coruscant/	15	1680180218.0	I cant believe for a second that they decamped from the central administrative power base for thousands of years to a random similar planet and left nothing behind

So far the script, visuals and intrigue are far behind Andor for me. Some reeeally clunky exposition lines and strange motivations so far. Not trying to bring Mando down, I just live in the hope that the bar raised by Andor will be the new standard for all series going forward!

The Phantom Menace is the most Star Wars Star Wars	1164	11vn5q6	TheNosilboogith	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/11vn5q6/the_phantom_menace_is_the_most_star_wars_star_wars/	312	1679236904.0	I am 37. Right in the middle. Where I grew up watching the OG Trilogy, and the Special Editions were released when I was a kid, I saw the Prequels released as a teenager, have played most of the games and read the EU Canon (now Legends) and have since seen it Gisney-fied.I think what Jon Favreau has done to the series is god-like. I LOVED THE LAST JEDI. I think the overall best Star Wars movie is Rogue One. My favorite character has always been Boba Fett and I adored Book of Boba Fett.Anyway. I have never understood why The Phantom Menace gets so much hate among the fandom. It still to this day, seems to be the most polarizing Star Wars movie. And its the most Star Wars movie. It is most similar to the original film. It has new graphics technology that still holds up. It has the set design, costumes and score. It has the campy tone of the originalNone of it is second rate or carbon copy, however. This was a fresh, interesting take on the series.We have Jedi and lightsabers within the first 10 minutes. And these people are afraid of these dudes, not like talking back to Darth Vader and using lightsabers as if they are Crayola Crayons.Immediately Palpatine. Shredding droids with lightsabers. Stowing down to the planet during a full invasion and going to an alien city underwater. Even as an adult I am so engaged in this film. The pacing is excellent - we have an action driven 30 minutes to set up Anakins introduction and Tatooines Mythos within the Universe.Then DARTH MAUL what. Dont care how underused stop. He is awesome because he is mysterious. And his arc is perfect. He is a fantastic villain to set up Obi-Wan as a top Jedi.The mix of CGI and practical holds up surprisingly well, given its age. It is somewhat cartoonish and whimsical in a way that none of the other mainline Star Wars movies are and given the plethora of Star Wars content we have, with the sale to Disney, the Legends designation to the old Expanded Universe and the animated Clone Wars fableYou wont find a more unique, fresh, daring or original Star Wars medium than the Phantom Menace. I still think it is a top moment in the series and one of the better films in the trilogy/trilogiespin-offs.TL; DR: The Phantom Menace is the most Star Wars movie for all the same reasons that people say it isnt. I have never had a bad time watching this movie and I regularly rewind entire scenes to watch them again - there is so much going on in this movie that is pure Star Wars from its source. Thank you, George.
What I love most about the new Disney series: how they depict the Empire.	39	11mfesi	DannyDeadhack	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/11mfesi/what_i_love_most_about_the_new_disney_series_how/	10	1678327085.0	What I love about all the recent Disney series taking place between III and IV, is that were seeing how fascistic and cruel the Empire is. The xenophobia, the weird experiments on people, their enslavement of political dissidents, their vast intelligence network infrastructure, the literal inquisition for Jedi, etc.We never really saw any of that on the ground level, other than them committing the ultimate genocide of blowing up entire planets.The Empire has always been such a massive machine, that just grinds alien and human life into dust, but its interesting how they keep finding ways to make you despise them even more.
I love they are exploring why the First Order could have risen despite being Empire 2.0. We forget in this universe not everyone suffered under the Empire. If you played ball you made a lot of money and the NR simply couldnt root out everyone who didnt outwardly defy the Empire.	507	11wqcy6	Mallee78	https://i.redd.it/97xme8ecpxoa1.png	80	1679335680.0	nan

I didn't know they achieved anything. I saw them destroy like three planets or however many, but I didn't know that meant the New Republic set up by the Rebel Alliance was defeated. One of my gripes with the First Order is that they just seemed like cosplaying wannabes.I can't be the only one that missed that huge plot point, right? Like, did the movie do a bad job of conveying that or did I just miss it like a dumbass? Who was ruling the galaxy at that point? Was the First Order actually on the level of the Empire and I just totally miss it?

In Andor, the Empire was shown as a cruel government that subjugated its citizens into prison complexes that were meant to stop any form of rebellion. In the Mandalorian, we are presented with the New Republic that is trying to provide a better way and even forgive those who were part of the Empire through the amnesty program. Watching the episode made me notice a parallel between how in Andor, Syril is placed in a bureaucratic machine, and how in the Mandalorian, Dr.Pershing is placed in a similar one. In the latter case, the scientist is punished for trying to take initiative due to the laws enforced in the New Republic and tortured for being considered a ""failure"" of the amnesty program. This made me wonder, what message is Star Wars trying to make about the role of big government. Especially if we consider the events that unfold in the Sequels and how the New Republic failed to stop the Empire due to their demilitarization, is this meant to be a general criticism of political organizations?I am wondering what other people are thinking about this topic!"

Hell, even in the prequels they had a lot of memorable moments together. The friendship between these two is part of what made the series special for me. Yet in the new trilogy he gets completely sidelined by BB-8 and barely shares any scenes with C3PO whatsoever. The Rise Of Skywalker gave C3PO quite a bit to do, yet even there there was minimal interaction between them. Why did R2-D2 get pushed so much to the side, and did any other people feel as disappointed by that as I was?

But what order would be best (considering I dont really remember the stories of them). 1-9 or do originals then prequels then sequels? My instinct was to go chronological but Im wondering if maybe the prequels dont play as well if you dont really know the story of the originals first?After I watch all these I also wanted to go and try clone wars and rebels. Gotta prepare for ahsoka and all this thrawn stuff babyyyy
I had my wisdom teeth pulled so I binged the new season of Mando and drew Din!	18	11zxn8y	fonepacecar	https://i.redd.it/94mx05bj1kpa1.jpg	2	1679606060.0	nan

George Lucas Star Wars Sequel Trilogy Made Leia the Chosen One and Darth Maul the Villain	311	120m83r	asura1958	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/120m83r/george_lucas_star_wars_sequel_trilogy_made_leia/	147	1679668553.0	George Lucas provides new details about his original plan for the Star Wars sequel trilogy in Taschens book The Star Wars Archives: 1999-2005 Perhaps the biggest revelation is that Lucas intended to resurrect Star Wars: The Phantom Menace villain Darth Maul and turn him into the main antagonist of the trilogy. Darth Maul would appear with mechanical legs and become the godfather of crime in the universe because, as the Empire falls, he takes over.Darth Maul trained a girl, Darth Talon, who was in the comic books, as his apprentice, Lucas continues, She was the new Darth Vader and most of the action was with her. So these were the two main villains of the trilogy.Source: 
A criticism of the sequels using Star Treks Strange New Worlds as a comparison.	0	11wmpif	Neptune686	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/11wmpif/a_criticism_of_the_sequels_using_star_treks/	10	1679328034.0	"Okay I understand that trashing the sequels is a sensitive topic for many, so to be fair, there are some good things about them. I admit that and I would never take that away from genuine sequel fans by gatekeeping or saying youre not allowed to enjoy them. Having said that, I want to draw a comparison to the sequels by highlighting an episode of Strange New Worlds, which is actually ""quite"" good. Id go as far as to say its incredible - the writing is certainly as good as some Star Wars content on Disney plus, even though I enjoy it less simply because its not Star Wars. Spoilers ahead for the season finale: Throughout the season, Captain Pike has been dealing with knowing his fate - that he will be critically injured in seven years, which will leave him completely mute, save for a wheelchair that allows him to answer yes and no questions. This is seen in the 60s series, where Spock literally risks his life to go to a planet where Pike can live a comfortable life. Its a long story so I wont get into it - the point is that Spock behaves extremely irrationally; he commits mutiny, lies to superiors, is almost court marshaled, and could even be executed (as the penalty for going to this planet is capital punishment). You may not know Star Trek but you know Spock - he wouldnt do something like that.Well the finale actually addresses this without calling attention to it. Essentially, Pike has figured out a way to avoid his fate, but learns (through time travel- I know) that any attempt to alter this event not only leads to war, but also kills Spock. Think of Doctor Strange in Infinity War - of all possible futures involving that incident, none exist that dont kill Spock. Except the one where Pike is mutilated. So, for a lot of reasons, Pike becomes comfortable with his fate. He does NOT know Spock will rescue him, he just knows about the accident. Present day Spock is aware of Pikes dilemma, and asks him about it. He tells Spock that he has accepted it, because avoiding it would sacrifice someone else. Spock intuitively understands what he means , and tells Pike that he wants to thank him, although hes not quite sure why. They have a touching moment where they express their admiration for each other, and the episode ends. Now I bring this up here because this is an example of making The Original Series ""better"". The writers understood Spocks odd behavior on that show and gave it meaning and context. In reality, the episode was merely the repackaged pilot where Jeffrey Hunter was captain, and Spock going crazy was just an excuse to put that episode on the air. But the writers did more with it. Did the sequels make episodes 1-6 better? I understand that they dont have the luxury of being prequels where they could fill in the blanks like Strange New Worlds did, but Abrams, Johnson and company had almost ""40 years"" of material to work with. Material that had weight and substance. I dont think the sequels even bothered with it beyond  a superficial level. They dont make you say oh man I wanna watch the prequels again so I can see what they were setting up in The Force Awakens!. They stand on their own with a bunch of somehows - somehow the Empire is back, somehow theres another guy who acts just like a Sith even though Anakin destroyed them, somehow they developed hyperspace tracking and Leia IMMEDIATELY knows that could be the only possible explanation, and somehow Palpatine returns. TL DR: I dont think those movies were written very well. Or, could have been written better. Star Trek provided a great example of how existing material can be enhanced with good writing."

He is told by multiple characters that he'd be much better off with a different droid. He's told the memory drive is destroyed, and his response is to find a new memory drive? As if it would retain the memories of the old drive? He is so adamant that it be this specific droid.  Then in the next episode he immediately gets grifted by Peli into buying a crappy astro droid? Is there something I'm missing or was that just a dumb storyline?

Apparently, Coruscant has at least 5,000 levels below this, and it becomes uninhabitable as you reach the actual surface of the planet. Id have to imagine that the farther down you go, the more disconnected youd be from whats going on in the galaxy. Im aware of the episode where Ahsoka meets those two sisters in the final season of the Clone Wars, and they distrust the Jedi.. but thats relatively close to the surface. Is there anything in canon or legends that discusses the lowest levels? For a laundry list of reasons , Id imagine the inhabitants would rarely leave, which probably means they have their own rules and government. But what do I know.

I expected to come to this sub and see fandom, but I feel like it is mostly gatekeepers. Are there plot holes, cliches, and annoyances in some of them, sure. But name a 9 movie series that doesnt have that? The hatred for the sequels is shocking to me honestly. Anyway, glad to be aboard now, may the force be with you all.

Would it be worth Lucasfilm getting a new actor on board to play young Temuera Morrison? Is it inevitable as the Clones get more live action screen time?	0	11aumyt	Androktone	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/11aumyt/would_it_be_worth_lucasfilm_getting_a_new_actor/	17	1677254086.0	"We're finally getting exploration of Jango Clones in live action, and so far they've all been at least somewhat justifiably played by Temuera Morrison based on where they are set in the timeline.Temuera Morrison is 60 odd and looks great for his age. He can easily play as young as 40s (30 y/o Boba right after the Sarlacc is pushing it), and if we ever get Rex or the other artificially-aging clones in the timeline of Mando/Ahsoka, then they could grey him up to portray a 35-40 year old clone pushing 70-80 physically.However having Morrison as the only live action actor currently precludes, without distracting and limiting CGI, Lucasfilm from telling live action stories with Jango Fett before his death, Boba Fett before the original trilogy, unmasked Clone troopers anytime prior to Kenobi (that's about 23 years or 46 at the oldest for the Clones), or any of the Bad Batch (it was them who I thought of first, I'd hate for them not to be on the table).Temuera Morrison was actually over 40 when he filmed AotC, who's clones were physically 20 at the oldest. Jango may have been older but the Clones themselves should've looked more like 1980s Tem.Daniel Logan and Brodie Taylor portrayed younger versions of Jango's identical clones. If those guys fit the bill it wouldn't be a question of if but when, but Brodie Taylor and Daniel Logan aren't routinely acting or much resemble Morrison, and the age range Taylor was meant to portray, he would've aged out of. But their portrayals gives precedence to the idea of audiences saying ""oh that's what Jango looks like"" even if it's not Morrison.I doubt they'll be many actors as talented and seasoned as Dee Baker is to pull off so many roles so consistently, but someone with a bit more fluctuation and vocal range than Morrison had, would be a nice bridge between the 2 performances. Dee not really pulling off the accent or gruffness (it's really awkward hearing him do Boba in games), and Morrison often leaning too much into the ""soldier"" and less the individuality, though he himself has some distinct acting choices to differentiate Jango, Boba, and the Clones.I could also see a Jango pre-prequel series having Morrison dub the character while he's under the mask to keep that consistency. That's kinda the best of both worlds.Are there any New Zealanders with the vocal and acting range needed? Obviously around 20-30 with a resemblance to Morrison/Bodie are factors. I'm not that well versed in New Zealand media so I'm not the guy to look to for a fancast, but if anyone knows someone who fits perfectly, I'd like to hear them."

If this alien race is ever brought into any visual canon material, should they keep their language or be given a new one?	0	11qwpdz	godzillavkk	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/11qwpdz/if_this_alien_race_is_ever_brought_into_any/	2	1678768638.0	Something from Legends that was brought into Canon not too long ago, were the Nelvaanians. They appeared in the 2003 Clone Wars show and are wolf like aliens who use tribal technology and inhabit a cold forested planet called Nelvaan. They were my favorite part of the 2003 show, but recently I learned something very interesting about them. The language they speak in the show... it's not a conlang like Huttese. It's actually Hungarian. This is because the director of the 2003 show, Gendy Tartakovsky, his wife is Hungarian.Now, Hungarian is not the most well versed language in America, nor is it the first Earth language turned into an alien language in Star Wars. But if the Nelvaanians are brought into any visual Canon story, do you think they can keep speaking Hungarian? Or would you create a conlang for them? If they choose the former, they better find some Hungarian actors. Everyone who voices a Nelvaanian in the show is American, and Hungarians have even said the spoken Hungarian in the show was difficult to understand with those thick American accents.
What lore from the Legends books are you bothered by being retconned in the new shows/movies? I personally dislike Kashyyyk's retcon more than anything.	0	11tfkav	Videowulff	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/11tfkav/what_lore_from_the_legends_books_are_you_bothered/	3	1679023012.0	For me it is how Kashyyyk is depicted. Kashyyyk was basically the Star Wars universe's mix of the Amazon Rain forest and Australia. It was one of the most hostile planets in the galaxy where practically everything from the plants to the insects wanted you dead.Wookies built their cities on top of their trees - not villages on/near the ground floor. Their cities were a mix of nature and tech - as the Wookies were shown to be one of the leaders in computer and ship technology innovation and manufacturing. Below the tree line was the Inner Forest of Kashyyyk - a place where even the bravest and strongest Wookies feared to tread unless forced too. You had giant plants that could snap closed with enough force to rip a Wookie's arm off. Giant snails who had a gaping maw with razor-like teeth on their undersides that could swallow men whole. A massive variety of toxic and poisonous flora that could knock you out, make you hallucinate, or lure you with their pheromones. Parasites, insects of varying sizes, and other forms of dangerous animals existed all beneath the canopy of Kashyyyk.And supposedly the planet's surface where the light barely touched the ground was even worse. Very few Wookies ventured that far down and survived to tell the tale.x200B;There are other deep-lore changes that I am disappointed in. Many aliens are depicted as being as fragile as humans - where a punch to the face can knock them out. Trandoshans, for example, were always shown to be serious threats in Legends. Their thick hides can take blaster hits (for example, it took Bossk several shots to seriously wound his father and even then, he had to finish him off point blank) and most humans couldn't do physical damage to Trandoshans with their bare hands. Trandoshans were basically as strong, if not stronger, than Wookies. They could literally rip the arms off humans with little effort but in the shows and movies now; a simple punch to the face is enough to knock them out. Which I get - I mean, I'm happy to see Trandoshans in the series because they always were one of my favorite species (Bossk ftw), but its a bummer seeing them nerfed.

Crime Syndicate as The Big Bad for the new movies.	7	10u82ib	ConscienceXP	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/10u82ib/crime_syndicate_as_the_big_bad_for_the_new_movies/	19	1675587006.0	Makes the most logical sense. The New Republic is gone, The First Order is gone, and you have a bunch of battle-hardened survivors on both sides who are now out of a job. Most planets would create alliances with other systems to bolster their defenses, but what about the more impoverished or isolated? Having a criminal syndicate to fill in this protector role would make sense, Id suspect that the pirate problem would become worse, so in steps this syndicate, offering protection at the price of governance. I suppose that a republic would begin to re-emerge but would the galaxy want or need it? These new movies have the potential to show a more anarchic version of the galaxy, ruled by warlords, criminals, and pirates. I hope that they capitalize on this potential new frontier.
Watching Rebels together with someone who never saw it during it's original release made me realize how unfairly we treated it.	143	125pgi5	Scandidi	https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/125pgi5/watching_rebels_together_with_someone_who_never/	42	1680099564.0	"I have been getting my gf into Star Wars content lately. A month ago we finished up the final season of Clone Wars and went straight to Rebels. This is the first time since it's original release that I am watching it, and for my gf it's her very first time.There is one other key difference: my gf got to watch a completed Clone Wars before going into this show, and it's really interesting to follow her journey, because it made me realize how different it is to experience Rebels when it's standing on it's own feat, rather than being ""the replacement"" for TCW.I remember when it originally came out, While most people warmed up to the show after it's first season, we cannot deny that our view of the show was heavily influenced by the cancellation of the Clone Wars, which at that time was only 5 seasons long and had landed on one of the most emotional stories we had seen.Rebels also came out during the Disney takeover, and I remember how our edgy teen brains thought that anything with the Disney logo on it would instantly become something only 6-year olds could watch, so when going into the show people had already painted a picture of what Rebels would be AND saw it as the thing that killed their favourite Star Wars show. It's no surprise that it had a rough start. My gf's reaction to it however is the complete opposite. She feels that the show is bringing back some temporary ""comfort"" that had been missing in the last seasons of TCW. After a huge emotional rollercoaster we finally get to settle down with the Ghost crew and take a breathe, and we get to ""build a new familly"" and enter a new era together. Instead of comparing it with TCW, she is seeing it as an extension of it, which is what the show was always supposed to be.Now that I am rewatching it, I actually get the same feeling. I actually don't think that the first season is as bad as many people said it was. Sure, it has a bit more slapstick, but now I can actually view it as a way of warming up to and building the new characters. They are no longer ""The guys that stole the spotlight from Anakin and Ahsoka"", and it really helps me as a viewer enjoy the season.I was wondering if others had the same experience?"
