izx4zfk	The_FriendliestGiant	t3_zjyvrr	In the aftermath of the Emperor using a strong centralized military force to overthrow the democratic Senate and seize total control of the Empire, the rebel groups made up of various CIS survivors, neo-Separatists, democratic partisans, and Republic nostalgists opted to do away with a strong centralized military force to avoid history repeating. A single fleet was maintained, but otherwise military forces devolved back down to a system/planet level, as had been the case for centuries before Palpatine and his stormtroopers came along.	t3_zjyvrr
izww5m7	James0nJuiceb0x	t3_zjyvrr	They demilitarized as a response to the Empire. The New Republic barely had a military.	t3_zjyvrr
izx5a7l	2hats4bats	t3_zjyvrr	"Chancellor Mon Mothma passed the ""Military Disarmament Act"" shortly after the Battle of Jakuu as a signal to the galaxy that the New Republic would not govern through force. As another show of peace, Mothma also granted amnesty to a lot of ex-Imperials. A lot of people disagreed with this decision, most notably Leia, Han and Lando which is why by the time we get to TFA, none of them are involved with the New Republic. I think this is one of the more interesting and compelling points of conflict that is explored in the books that take place post Endor like ""Last Shot"", ""Aftermath"" and its touched on in the ""Alphabet Squadron"" books."	t3_zjyvrr
izxxdcs	EndlessTheorys_19	t3_zjyvrr	The NR was heavily demilitarised. Instead of a massive standing military like the Empire, they had a smaller one that mostly followed the Senate around and responded to events when ordered. Local planets and sectors would then have their own defence fleets which theoretically could be called upon in times of crisis, like the Galactic Republic had. When Starkiller Base blew up the NR Senate in TFA these Planetary Defence fleets stayed close to their own planets out of fear of a coming First Order attack.	t3_zjyvrr
izwvy99	DoctorUnderhill97	t3_zjyvrr	The Republic was demilitarized. It didn't have a fleet.	t3_zjyvrr
izxozvu	Titan828	t3_zjyvrr	"Though we have snippets of the New Republic in Mandalorian and BoBF, I hope that we see more of it in ""Ahsoka""."	t3_zjyvrr
izxya1y	ccg5058	t3_zjyvrr	In an age where there is hyper space travel (faster than light) its probably best to have your military concentrated. This is for defense. If a planet or planets is attacked they could be distributed as need be. This is diff than the empire that was controlling every planet through force and fear (they needed to be omnipresent).	t3_zjyvrr
izyh0vc	Hooligan_Humble	t3_zjyvrr	"All the people in the comments thinking they're clever for harping about ""The New Republic is so dumb for not having a military"" completely forgetting the previous Republic didn't bother with having one until the enemy was at the door and a Clone Army was dropped in their laps."	t3_zjyvrr
izxg1co	hhyyz	t3_zjyvrr	Must've had the same leaders as us back in '41.  Didn't think the bad guys making war (over there) were that much of a threat, so lets put our entire fleet at Pearl.	t3_zjyvrr
izys6e3	FlopsMcDoogle	t3_zjyvrr	Probably didn't think anyone had a weapon that could fuck a whole star system in 1 shot.	t3_zjyvrr
izx06lg	SamVimesThe1st	t3_zjyvrr	Why was the US Navy not spread out over the Pacific?	t3_zjyvrr
izxxyub	TheTinDog	t3_zjyvrr	eh, I mean there are in universe explanations that came out after the fact but really JJ Abrams just kind of threw us into a galaxy with zero background information to explain wtf was going on.	t3_zjyvrr
izyhmuh	LaylaLegion	t3_zjyvrr	They demilitarized as the only other galactic superpower were the Mandolorians and theyre pretty much quiet unless you enter their space.So you know, stay out of Mandolorian space.	t3_zjyvrr
j00vne8	ErichW3D	t3_zjyvrr	Youre describing most major nations of the world in history.  At one point France and Spain almost owned the globe, now look at em.  Why isnt Rome all of Europe and Africa?	t3_zjyvrr
izxmrii	Megleeker	t3_zjyvrr	It ain't that kinda movie kid	t3_zjyvrr
izxznal	The_DevilAdvocate	t3_zjyvrr	The real question is why weren't the planets spread out across space. They are like right next to each other.	t3_zjyvrr
izwyhi2	Ankh-Morporknbeans	t3_zjyvrr	It was the only way to give us A New Hope again	t3_zjyvrr
izxuug4	TheVolunteer0002	t3_zjyvrr	Because it's a lazy, poorly written film. That's what it ultimately boils down to.	t3_zjyvrr
izxyir8	EnvironmentalBee7422	t3_zjyvrr	"Yeah, I definitely see this as a pretty glaring flaw with the setup for the Sequel Trilogy.I feel like a lot of the plot conflicts could have been avoided if the New Republic maintained a military force. It probably wouldn't have prevented Kylo Ren becoming a Dark Side warrior but it absolutely would have saved the Hosnian system.It's not like after WWII, every country that fought the Axis Powers thought ""Yup, bad guys defeated. We don't need a military any more. Certainly nothing bad will come of us just hanging up our spurs and leaving them be.""Whatever, though. It is what it is."	t3_zjyvrr
izxaai2	FearlessTarget2806	t3_zjyvrr	If into the logic of the sequels you go, only pain you will find...	t3_zjyvrr
izydhl4	Savsal14	t3_zjyvrr	"They demilitarized 90% of their military (cant remember the exact percentage)Cause ""having a military is oppressive and we will just be a new empire if we have armed forces"" (lol that was really the argument)Plus, half the new senate, which was militarist, went to voluntarily join the first order after realizing the new republic was unwilling and unable to offer them order and safety,Leaving only the idealist pacifists to run the showThats what i remember reading in the new canon novels....And yeah... it really felt like they were trying to push a ""the empire might have had the right idea about many things after all"" kinda angle which was interesting to say the least."	t3_zjyvrr
izyjz2n	Zodiac4v2	t3_zjyvrr	Its a read between the lines style in the movies. They talk about the First Order and the Emperor coming back but seems like the New Republic was never bothered by it and seemed to not believe there was any truth to it. That was really stupid to me because look at countries here on Earth, every one of them has a military of some form or another. Youd think that after the empire theyd want something to have some sort of protection against any form of hostile force.	t3_zjyvrr
izyqpnc	Webby41	t3_zjyvrr	Because whoever wrote the new movies is stupid.	t3_zjyvrr
izysl1e	Zedtomb	t3_zjyvrr	Something tells me Disney didn't think that far ahead	t3_zjyvrr
izx0ehb	McFlyJL	t3_zjyvrr	Dumb writing	t3_zjyvrr
izyno4e	SavisSon	t3_zjyvrr	Because if they didnt, thered be no movie. Duh.	t3_zjyvrr
izy6hfd	astroshark	t3_zjyvrr	The in universe explanation (that came out after TFA released) is that Mon Mothma unilaterally disarmed the New Republic. It is absurd, makes no sense and sets the tone for Mon Mothma in the new canon to be irreconcilable with the OT Mon Mothma. Basically all of the world building around the ST is the Star Wars group working backwards to fix different things in the ST that don't make sense.	t3_zjyvrr
izyfzi1	PerformerOwn194	t3_zjyvrr	Because 0 seconds of thought went into any aspect of the script	t3_zjyvrr
izz0w4l	yezsetva	t3_zjyvrr	I hope they will just reboot this trilogy	t3_zjyvrr
izzyp53	Oribj	t3_zjyvrr	its almost like it was a horrible movie or something	t3_zjyvrr
izwwbzj	Specialist_Insect_15	t3_zjyvrr	The New Order destroyed 5 planets, the entire Hosnian system. That basically WAS the New Republic. They were wiped out across their territory, all of it.	t3_zjyvrr
izz86js	crispier_creme	t3_zjyvrr	So it's easier to get them out of the way so it's easier to rehash a rebels vs empire plotline	t3_zjyvrr
izzodqm	sireNeo	t3_zjyvrr	That plus the fact that after probably the biggest act of mass genocide ever witnessed in the main films not a single soul in the Resistance decided to radio the New Republic (I think Leia at least tried in a deleted scene, but yeah... that was a deleted scene...) and tell them 'holy shit a death star planet just annihilated the entire Hosnian system, for the love of god please send help'. Or even surrounding independent military forces like in TROS when Lando manages to smooth-talk a fuck load of independent ships into fighting the Final Order's fleet of Death-Star-Laser-Equipped Star-Destroyers. Like could no one achieve that or even a fraction of that number to assault Star Killer base? Or when the First Order was, as far as we knew at that time, reduced to a single fleet of Star-Destroyers and one big Star-Destroyer that had the current head of their regime in it?This trilogy really should have started with the New Republic in power, with the First Order launching small but numerous terrorist strikes. Like maybe the Republic tries to convert some old Empire super weapon into a energy generator or whatever, have the First Order sabotage and use it as the old Empire weapon to generate fear in the galaxy of the Empire's return, or instill the idea that the New Republic could be just as tyrannical as the Empire was.	t3_zjyvrr
j012yar	Independent-Dig-5757	t3_zjyvrr	Because the movie blows and JJ Abrams needed an excuse to do a rehash of A New Hope	t3_zjyvrr
izykwb3	Healthy-Drink3247	t1_izx4zfk	It was also the case before the clone wars. The republic had no standing military. My guess is that Mon Mothma remembered what the republic was like before the clone wars, and decided that the military allowed palps to take control. So she scaled it back to pre clone wars levels to limit that from happening	t3_zjyvrr
izy3lvp	Pingaring	t1_izww5m7	"According to history, the side that looses is the one that gets demilitarized. It's almost like someone just made this up as they went al- ""wait"""	t3_zjyvrr
izy2s2r	Ntippit	t1_izww5m7	Then they are idiots lol	t3_zjyvrr
izyaruh	Salarian_American	t1_izx5a7l	"Bloodline also focused on this a lot, showing how the Republic Senate was tied up with a lot of ex-Imperials and Imperial sympathizers who kept crying ""Fake News"" when people were trying to bring the issue of the growing First Order to attention.  And then those same Imperial sympathizers outed Leia as a the daughter of Darth Vader, which ended her political career and led to her forming the Resistance to combat the First Order because the Republic was too tied up in protocol and procedure to do anything useful."	t3_zjyvrr
izydt8u	BacoNaterr	t1_izx5a7l	Really butchered Mon	t3_zjyvrr
izxjid8	Vesemir96	t1_izwvy99	They did have a fleet. Just not a large one.	t3_zjyvrr
izx754f	DoctorUnderhill97	t1_izwvy99	Wait, why are people downvoting me? That's an in-universe fact.	t3_zjyvrr
izzbfuj	webchimp32	t1_izxozvu	Reduced to the role of space cops.	t3_zjyvrr
izzur7n	ThrorII	t1_izyh0vc	Yes, but there was no opposing side to the Republic until the Separatist Crisis. The New Republic literally had an enemy government next door in the First Order. To disarm when your enemy still exists is foolish and unrealistic.	t3_zjyvrr
jcyoonc	imtrinichadian	t1_izyh0vc	almost like they should have learned from those mistakes?	t3_zjyvrr
jcyotks	imtrinichadian	t1_izys6e3	thats dumb	t3_zjyvrr
izyrp7c		t1_izx06lg	They are.	t3_zjyvrr
izx1rtj	JorenM	t1_izx06lg	The us navy is spread out across many oceans though	t3_zjyvrr
izzqi50	Background-Factor817	t1_izyhmuh	Apart from the KOTOR era when have the Mandalorians ever been a superpower?	t3_zjyvrr
izyes13	Salarian_American	t1_izxyir8	"Yeah it was a terrible idea to do it that way, you're absolutely right.  That's true in-universe.  There was a lot of concerted opposition to the demilitarization, not just from ""bad guys"" either."	t3_zjyvrr
izzv862	ThrorII	t1_izxyir8	Better analogy: We defeated the NAZI's, but a fragment survived. I'm sure they'll never be a problem again. Let's demilitarize and ignore what ever they might be doing....	t3_zjyvrr
izyykd9	The_FriendliestGiant	t1_izy6hfd	The New Republic demilitarizing makes far more sense given what we now know of the pre-Empire period. In the old Legends the New Republic was built on the assumption that the Republic before the Empire had been a normal state with a normal military, but then the PT came around and we learned that the old Republic hadn't had a military in who knows how long and the creation of the military led directly to Palpatine's takeover. He didn't corrupt an existing institution, he introduced a brand new one to facilitate his rise to power. Makes sense that the anti-Imperial rebellion would have entry of members who were anti-standing military, as well. There's even real world precedence for it, with the Americans trying to devolve the military to state forces after their succesful rebellion against the British Empire.	t3_zjyvrr
izyf5vq	Salarian_American	t1_izy6hfd	The in universe explanation (that came out after TFA released) is that Mon Mothma unilaterally disarmed the New Republic. That's not really accurate.  The novel series that broke down what was going on in the universe in the early New Republic came out before TFA did by about 3 months, and Mon Mothma didn't unilaterally disarm the New Republic, it was a huge political struggle for her to get what she wanted and the opposition to it was depicted as reasonable.	t3_zjyvrr
izya9q1	Salarian_American	t1_izy3lvp	Well when two nations go to war, when the war is over, both nations still exist.  The Empire was not meant to continue existing at all, so it wouldn't make any sense for that side to be demilitarized since it wasn't supposed to exist anymore.	t3_zjyvrr
izyowp1	SavisSon	t1_izy3lvp	I mean, the idea is that the biggest threat to the Republic was internal, like how Palpatine took it over last time. A military force that answered to him. An external threat wasnt considered to be the gravest danger.	t3_zjyvrr
izy3vff	James0nJuiceb0x	t1_izy3lvp	You mean a fictional story was made up? Wow.	t3_zjyvrr
j019779	NotYetAJedi	t1_izy2s2r	If the New Republic were idiots, then so was The Galactic Republic, before Attack of the Clones	t3_zjyvrr
izydzs9	2hats4bats	t1_izydt8u	Characters make mistakes	t3_zjyvrr
izym9hw	The_FriendliestGiant	t1_izx754f	Hux: This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate, to their cherished fleet. The New Republic had a fleet. They just only had the one, at Hosnian Prime.	t3_zjyvrr
j019li8	The_FriendliestGiant	t1_izzbfuj	In peace time, what more should they be?	t3_zjyvrr
izzuxn9	Hooligan_Humble	t1_izzur7n	But most of the New Republic either refused to believe The First Order existed or were in their pocketsAll I'm saying is there was a precedent for a pacifist Republic.Edit: it's also worth noting that in it's formation The First Order was hidden in the outer reaches.	t3_zjyvrr
izx37r6	SamVimesThe1st	t1_izx1rtj	Sure. The point I was trying to make, is that it is not unusual to have military troop and material concentrations when you are not at war and not expecting a surprise attack with a weapon/weapons that can get to the specific location. Makes logistics easier and cheaper.	t3_zjyvrr
izzwhg0	LaylaLegion	t1_izzqi50	Like always? They have advanced weaponry that rivals the Republic and theyre master tacticians and warriors. Theyre the only people who can go toe to toe with Force Users. Even the Empire knew to respect their borders, Palpatine didnt even try to encroach their territory.	t3_zjyvrr
izzzao7	EnvironmentalBee7422	t1_izzv862	"My dude ""literally"".It just doesn't make sense. It would make way more sense if, for example, the New Republic had tried to militarize but was continually fought by the First Order, culminating in a weak armada leaving them open to the attack on Hosnian Prime. Their resources seem limitless. Where are they getting these resources? The ships? The manpower?And there you have a justification for Exegol and Palpatine still existing. If only Disney had given Star Wars the time, attention, and planning they gave to the MCU when it first started."	t3_zjyvrr
izz2eh6	astroshark	t1_izyykd9	The problem is that the Empire never really goes away post ROTJ and just morphs into the First Order. Demilitarizing as a way of returning to the old ways the former old Republic senators knows would make sense if the galaxy was at some form of peace... but the galactic civil war never really fully ends, the sides just change names. It really just makes no sense, both narratively and in universe wise. It's just a way to justify the conflict in TFA.	t3_zjyvrr
j6fk7c4	XD7006	t1_j019779	that's the point	t3_zjyvrr
izye62e	BacoNaterr	t1_izydzs9	Frequently post rotj it seems. As if they learned nothing from the past	t3_zjyvrr
jcyoh5w	imtrinichadian	t1_izydzs9	thats actually pretty stupid and bad writing	t3_zjyvrr
izyo46k	DoctorUnderhill97	t1_izym9hw	Yes. What OP was talking about.	t3_zjyvrr
jcyokfa	imtrinichadian	t1_j019li8	probably preventing the death star 3 from being constructed	t3_zjyvrr
izypc9l	mcbride-bushman	t1_izx37r6	"But with that the US uses the navy as a maritime force projection aswell as a maritime ""sea police force"" of sorts "	t3_zjyvrr
j019osw	The_FriendliestGiant	t1_izzwhg0	The Night of a Thousand Tears rather suggests otherwise.	t3_zjyvrr
j01awxw	Background-Factor817	t1_izzwhg0	Theyre a regional power at best in my opinion, a superpower means theyre on par with the Empire or Sith Empire at their height.	t3_zjyvrr
izzfxgn	The_FriendliestGiant	t1_izz2eh6	Except the First Order keeps an extremely low profile after the Battle of Jakku. The Empire basically collapses as far as the galaxy at large is concerned, and the Resistance is a deniable black ops group conducting operations in the back end of nowhere-space, trying to trace back a threat most of the Republic doesn't believe exists anymore.It's not like in Legends, where the Imperial Remnant is a distinct political entity with known territories and open displays of military conflict.	t3_zjyvrr
izyeu91	2hats4bats	t1_izye62e	Thats exactly why Leia, Han, Lando and many others disagreed with it.	t3_zjyvrr
j074l6b	The_FriendliestGiant	t1_izye62e	Mon Mothma watched Emperor Palpatine consolidate centralized military power to the point of dissolving the democratic Senate which had stood for a millenia and ruling by naked force; it's perfectly reasonable for her to learn that having a strong centralized military presents a danger to the democracy of the Republic.	t3_zjyvrr
jcyongq	2hats4bats	t1_jcyoh5w	I fundamentally disagree.	t3_zjyvrr
izyyykx	The_FriendliestGiant	t1_izyo46k	Right, but you were wrong when you said the New Republic didn't have a fleet; that's why you were downvoted.	t3_zjyvrr
jcypmhm	The_FriendliestGiant	t1_jcyokfa	That's a failure of New Republic Intelligence; the navy can't destroy what intelligence doesn't tell them exists!	t3_zjyvrr
j01axg4	ashoka_tano_bot	t1_j01awxw	With great power comes great responsibility.	t3_zjyvrr
j074mpo	ashoka_tano_bot	t1_j074l6b	Well boys, we did it democracy is no more.	t3_zjyvrr
izyzuoh	DoctorUnderhill97	t1_izyyykx	Ok. Sure. Op was saying why didn't they have a fleet to cover the galaxy, and the Republic had no such fleet, just a small one based on the home system, as OP says. They have no galaxy-spanning fleet anywhere on the scale of the Clone Wars era Republic or the Empire. Are you happy now? Dear Lord, some of you folks on this sub...	t3_zjyvrr
jcypxho	imtrinichadian	t1_jcypmhm	it sounds like bad writing to rehash old movies for nostalgia	t3_zjyvrr
jcyq09c	imtrinichadian	t1_jcypmhm	it sounds like bad writing to rehash old movies for nostalgia sake	t3_zjyvrr
izz38i8	Borghal	t1_izyzuoh	"There is a difference between ""no fleet"" and ""no such fleet""...""Words, what do they mean?!"""	t3_zjyvrr
izz5mxp	DoctorUnderhill97	t1_izz38i8	I hope you feel good about how you spend your time.	t3_zjyvrr
izza7vq	Borghal	t1_izz5mxp	It is a worthy fight!	t3_zjyvrr
izzgw0t	DoctorUnderhill97	t1_izza7vq	Hahaha. Cheers friend.	t3_zjyvrr
